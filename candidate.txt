It was difficult to find an apartment with no credit history but Ian made it so easy. With Ian's help, I was able to view multiple apartments remotely and he was considerate enough to help me find an apartment within my budget and in a great neighbourhood, close to my office. I have moved into my new apartment since and I absolutely love it here and it wouldn't have been possible without Ian. Thank you so much!<br/>HARSHITA DADDALA<br/>REVIEW DATE<br/>09/20/2017<br/><br/>Ian was absolutely amazing! He really listened to what we wanted in an apartment and made sure to only take us to see units that fit this criteria. He was always checking in on us to make sure everything was going smoothly, even right up to our move-in date. I would highly recommend Ian for anyone looking to make apartment hunting super easy!!!<br/>Elise F<br/>Sept 13, 2017<br/><br/>Ian is a great resource for finding apartments that fit your criteria. He works hard and is always reachable. He is a professional and quick to respond to any question you have. I would recommend him to anyone looking for an apartment, especially in the Upper East Side.<br/>April 2017<br/>Ryan<br/><br/>- Crystal W. Austin, TX,   May 08, 2017<br/>I worked with Ian J Sossen at Anchor and I'm pleased with the experience. I got in contact with Ian 1-2 days before I came to NY for viewings and he quickly showed me a few no-fee places on the upper east side within my budget. I liked one of the places he showed me but couldn't make a decision. After a few days, I was in NY again visiting friends and decided to take another look at the unit. I texted him in the afternoon around 4:30 for a 7pm showing. He immediately replied and took me to the building again but showed a better unit with the same layout on a higher floor, which I chose as my new home. I'm very happy with Ian. To summarize, he's no-BS, polite, accommodating and respectful of my time. Compared with other brokers I met, he does not push you into something you are not sure about. I appreciate his approach of showing you options but leaving you space and time to make your own decision. <br/><br/>- RICHARD Z,   May 08, 2017<br/>Ian helped us find the absolute perfect apartment. He was so attentive and persistent and would not rest until we had he place that we wanted. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone looking for a new home!

The bold vision of creating an impeccable first impression upon arriving to the Freeman Corner was brought to fruition by elevating the building's base, and exposing exterior concrete pylons to create a promenade-like effect.<br/><br/>One, two, and three-bed residences are prominently featured with heightened interior quality and spatial concepts. Utilizing the complex's unique lot sizes, the Freeman Corner offers equally unique layouts - some with corner exposure, some with city views, but all with sun-soaking natural light! Kitchens are finished with caesarstone countertops, stainless steel appliances w/ dishwashers, as well as Carrera marble backsplashes. Poised to maintain the Freeman Corner's rusticity, the developers left select units with high ceilings unfinished and untouched to bring a loft-like feel to the renter. Each residence is also equipped with HVAC heating/cooling systems and Bluetooth surround-sound speakers!<br/><br/>Residents at the Freeman Corner will have free 24-hour access to the building's sprawling fitness center & yoga room, large laundry room, bike storage, and fully furnished communal roof deck with Manhattan skyline views. Indoor garage parking is also available (inquire for pricing). There's an elevator as well, and the building is protected 24/7 by virtual doorman security systems.<br/><br/>Come rediscover Greenpoint - you're just steps away from spots such as Paulie Gee's, Adelina's, Black Rabbit, Esme, and my personal favorites: Milk & Roses, The Moonlight Mile, and Greenpoint Fish & Lobster. Otherwise, stroll down Manhattan Avenue and explore Greenpoint's renewed quaint vibe for yourself! And train access couldn't be more convenient  easily walk or bike over the Pulaski Bridge and catch the 7-train one stop into Manhattan; or take the G-train just four blocks away!<br/><br/><br/>Contact me by call, text, or email to schedule a private showing or for any additional information. Text me for the fastest response. Net rent may be advertised. Photos may be of similar units in the building. Select units with private outdoor space. I also have access to any property on and off the market, so let me know how I can help you find your new home!<br/>|40.7348|-73.9528|Fitness Center;elevator;garage;pets;Central Air;Gym;Trash Compactor;Controlled Access;Gated Entry;Intercom System;Secured Entry;Security System;Sprinkler System;Bike Room;Elevator;Garage Parking;Laundry In Building;Live In Super;New Development;Outdoor Areas;Package Room;Parking Available;Verizon FiOS Available;Virtual Doorman;No Fee;Exclusive|https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338912_b606a1a7dee5d4639c255d4561ff86ba.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338912_0f2ad6a4f2759f09fe6204aa034a08e5.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338912_df032f42af3feef65f5249d321e191c1.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338912_0d9ba73a37d4079e2f5749058d0b2e45.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338912_2271008c4f2a95e14baf1251ea19bf6e.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338912_06a80a6879b50f438cd86722c19364bf.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338912_e7658bec72893b43e5ef304f83f4773b.jpg

Living room is very large, with plenty of space for living and dining areas. Freshly tiled bathroom has a window and soaking tub.<br/><br/>Clean and well maintained elevator building.<br/>Take advantage of the culture that only NYC can offer at Lincoln Center or the Metropolitan Opera. You might just take advantage of your kitchen and cook more when you live so close to Trader Joe's! If you rather let someone else do the cooking, nearby Lincoln Square Steak should do the trick. If you are in the mood for something lighter, try Vanguard Wine Bar or Alice's Tea Cup.ARE YOU RELOCATING TO NYC? Call me!

Call or text for the fastest response!<br/><br/>Customized as chic residences with an industrial touch comes the Freeman Corner, a set of brand new residential buildings designed and constructed by renowned architecture firm Studios C. The bold vision of creating an impeccable first impression upon arriving to the Freeman Corner was brought to fruition by elevating the building's base, and exposing exterior concrete pylons to create a promenade-like effect!<br/><br/>2 BALONCIES (one off living room and one off of the back bedroom)<br/><br/>One, two, and three-bed residences are prominently featured with heightened interior quality and spatial concepts. Utilizing the complex's unique lot sizes, the Freeman Corner offers equally unique layouts some with corner exposure, some with city views, but all with sun-soaking natural light! Kitchens are finished with caesarstone countertops, stainless steel appliances w/ dishwashers, as well as Carrera marble backsplashes. Poised to maintain the Freeman Corner's rusticity, the developers left the building's high ceilings unfinished and untouched to bring a loft-like feel to the renter. Each residence is also equipped with HVAC heating/cooling systems and Bluetooth surround-sound speakers!<br/><br/>Residents at the Freeman Corner will have free 24-hour access to the building's sprawling fitness center & yoga room, large laundry room, bike storage, and fully furnished communal roof deck with Manhattan skyline views. Indoor garage parking is also available (inquire for pricing)! There's an elevator as well, and the building is protected 24/7 by virtual doorman security systems!<br/><br/>Come rediscover Greenpoint you're just steps away from spots such as Paulie Gee's, Adelina's, Black Rabbit, Esme, and my personal favorites: Milk & Roses, The Moonlight Mile, and Greenpoint Fish & Lobster. Otherwise, stroll down Manhattan Avenue and explore Greenpoint's renewed quaint vibe for yourself! And train access couldn't be more convenient easily walk or bike over the Pulaski Bridge and catch the 7-train one stop into Manhattan; or take the G-train just four blocks away!<br/>|40.7348|-73.9528|Fitness Center;elevator;garage;dishwasher;pets;Central Air;Doublepane windows;High Ceilings;Light;Gym;Marble Bath;Windowed;Garbage Disposal;Granite Kitchen Counter;Open Kitchen;Refrigerator;Stainless Steel Appliances;Trash Compactor;Balcony;Living Room;Controlled Access;Gated Entry;Intercom System;Secured Entry;Security System;Sprinkler System;Window Coverings;Bike Room;Dishwasher;Elevator;Exposed Brick;Garage Parking;Hardwood Floors;Laundry In Building;Live In Super;Microwave;New Development;Outdoor Areas;Package Room;Parking Available;Renovated;Verizon FiOS Available;Virtual Doorman;No Fee;Exclusive|https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_9f7642ebfd5f26dfd83937748da9d5e4.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_fc2362b7fc06c37d5272999c4fdaa1c4.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_7d514512df37471202d1cb57c1d8c9ab.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_6606b38f467dbad244ea7dffc10a96db.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_23d2b64fc10757c2786e22199b924bf3.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_863e903c200610a6ecf4dbbf52f88d18.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_ba46c46aae010a0736cb918e49d82e2b.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_79e74844500deb8b823363dc5a04cd40.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_19af7e8c4d20e97b40df71418e0c03b0.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_1ee959c319b11892fe46e5a6ebecd3b3.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_8fad57c5df3f30556ca6e95374fb4f9f.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_23ffac99667c66e883fe04a52edaa5e3.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_68ecab10f027fc11c6e8786876367f8a.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_ab0c8c5da2ffb5557c677222b00f4e0e.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_f2576db4f51de9edb66683400b9fcf42.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_bf7e60587c863d4f21a344840f055ef9.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_c10ca7000a88018891e043c8374c4858.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12338919_d6c277042b4293ea78cfb2e78c155875.jpg

He works hard and is always reachable. He is a professional and quick to respond to any question you have. I would recommend him to anyone looking for an apartment, especially in the Upper East Side.<br/>April 2017<br/>Ryan<br/><br/>- Crystal W. Austin, TX,   May 08, 2017<br/>I worked with Ian J Sossen at Anchor and I'm pleased with the experience. I got in contact with Ian 1-2 days before I came to NY for viewings and he quickly showed me a few no-fee places on the upper east side within my budget. I liked one of the places he showed me but couldn't make a decision. After a few days, I was in NY again visiting friends and decided to take another look at the unit. I texted him in the afternoon around 4:30 for a 7pm showing. He immediately replied and took me to the building again but showed a better unit with the same layout on a higher floor, which I chose as my new home. I'm very happy with Ian. To summarize, he's no-BS, polite, accommodating and respectful of my time. Compared with other brokers I met, he does not push you into something you are not sure about.

Austin, TX,   May 08, 2017<br/>I worked with Ian J Sossen at Anchor and I'm pleased with the experience. I got in contact with Ian 1-2 days before I came to NY for viewings and he quickly showed me a few no-fee places on the upper east side within my budget. I liked one of the places he showed me but couldn't make a decision. After a few days, I was in NY again visiting friends and decided to take another look at the unit. I texted him in the afternoon around 4:30 for a 7pm showing. He immediately replied and took me to the building again but showed a better unit with the same layout on a higher floor, which I chose as my new home. I'm very happy with Ian. To summarize, he's no-BS, polite, accommodating and respectful of my time. Compared with other brokers I met, he does not push you into something you are not sure about. I appreciate his approach of showing you options but leaving you space and time to make your own decision. <br/><br/>- RICHARD ZIMMERMAN,   May 08, 2017<br/>Ian helped us find the absolute perfect apartment. He was so attentive and persistent and would not rest until we had he place that we wanted. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone looking for a new home!

The bold vision of creating an impeccable first impression upon arriving to the Freeman Corner was brought to fruition by elevating the building's base, and exposing exterior concrete pylons to create a promenade-like effect.  One, two, and three-bed residences are prominently featured with heightened interior quality and spatial concepts. Utilizing the complex's unique lot sizes, the Freeman Corner offers equally unique layouts some with corner exposure, some with city views, but all with sun-soaking natural light! Kitchens are finished with caesarstone countertops, stainless steel appliances w/ dishwashers, as well as Carrera marble backsplashes. Poised to maintain the Freeman Corner's rusticity, the developers left select units with high ceilings unfinished and untouched to bring a loft-like feel to the renter. Each residence is also equipped with HVAC heating/cooling systems and Bluetooth surround-sound speakers!  Residents at the Freeman Corner will have free 24-hour access to the building's sprawling fitness center & yoga room, large laundry room, bike storage, and fully furnished communal roof deck with Manhattan skyline views. Indoor garage parking is also available (inquire for pricing). There's an elevator as well, and the building is protected 24/7 by virtual doorman security systems.  Come rediscover Greenpoint you're just steps away from spots such as Paulie Gee's, Adelina's, Black Rabbit, Esme, and my personal favorites: Milk & Roses, The Moonlight Mile, and Greenpoint Fish & Lobster. Otherwise, stroll down Manhattan Avenue and explore Greenpoint's renewed quaint vibe for yourself! And train access couldn't be more convenient easily walk or bike over the Pulaski Bridge and catch the 7-train one stop into Manhattan; or take the G-train just four blocks away!

The gross rent is $6,350 with the option to renew after the lease term. 52H is spacious, bright, and has incredible views from every corner.

Enjoy complimentary yoga and Pilates classes.  Located in the heart of the iconic Financial District, the residences at this building brings modern vitality to an important piece of New York City history. A monument to the economic engines and people that helped to shape the world's commerce, the building's present-day incarnation retains the rich spirit of the past as it provides renters with a wealth of contemporary amenities - at great value.  Designed by the architectural firm Cross & Cross and completed in 1931, the 57-story, steel-framed, granite and limestone structure was originally the Wall Street area headquarters of City Bank Farmers Trust (now CitiBank). It remains a distinctive and prominent feature in the lower Manhattan skyline. Up close, it's apparent that this buildings magnificent Art Deco and classical elements harken to its "moneyed" beginnings. An imposing entrance arch is carved with 11 international coins (which represented the former bank's global presence) and, from the tops of 14 majestic columns, the captains of finance gaze down on those who enter a lobby that retains its glorious, original bank hall attributes.   Inside the residences, modern style and comfort prevail. The apartments feature gorgeous NYC views, tall ceilings (some 11 feet) and modern kitchens with state-of-the-art stainless steel Liebherr and Fisher & Paykel appliances and custom European cabinets. The baths are elegantly appointed with marble floors, contemporary tiling, and custom sinks and vanities.   A short walk from the caverns of Wall Street, this building offers dividends to provide the perfect respite from hard-charging workdays. Depending on the mood, chose to hit the roof deck for breathtaking sunset views of New York harbor; relax or entertain at the Lounge's wet bar or billiards table; or sweat off stress on the state-of-the-art Techno Gym cardio and weight training equipment. A 24-hour concierge and valet service ensure packages, dry cleaning, and other needs will be well taken care of.   Steps from the busy beer bars of Stone Street and mere blocks from the mixologists of the Dead Rabbit and the historic Fraunces Tavern, the rental prices leave budget enough to thoroughly enjoy the nearby socializing, as well as the shopping, dining, and sightseeing of the Financial District, the South Street Seaport, lower Broadway, Brookfield Place, and Brooklyn, which is just one subway stop away. The building's close proximity to eight subway lines means speedy access to the rest of the city, as well.|40.7055|-74.0096|Cats Allowed;Dogs Allowed;Doorman;Elevator;Fitness Center;Laundry In Building;Common Outdoor Space;Storage Facility;dishwasher|https://photos.renthop.com/2/12157293_fd2fb8fbc7bf9a0dbab8a59ea2438dda.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12157293_5e44b8aa467981f1da57e745e455fc2b.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12157293_79bd95a2f38642d3bce261b91d35a0ae.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12157293_8637b7d6fb775e4bea3b6a27cb440b43.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12157293_86b214a0aecc8b36e7e577245af138b1.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12157293_1ab9d5e1a294f0984314ca566b8a5541.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12157293_67eb029c50b32062d77d66664a55dacd.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12157293_b13d4ff8f62dc4bb709b04d4d473b7eb.jpg;https://photos.renthop.com/2/12157293_91b968b7c204d76578669aa643ac8095.jpg

Austin, TX,   May 08, 2017<br/>I worked with Ian J Sossen at Anchor and I'm pleased with the experience. I got in contact with Ian 1-2 days before I came to NY for viewings and he quickly showed me a few no-fee places on the upper east side within my budget. I liked one of the places he showed me but couldn't make a decision. After a few days, I was in NY again visiting friends and decided to take another look at the unit. I texted him in the afternoon around 4:30 for a 7pm showing. He immediately replied and took me to the building again but showed a better unit with the same layout on a higher floor, which I chose as my new home. I'm very happy with Ian. To summarize, he's no-BS, polite, accommodating and respectful of my time. Compared with other brokers I met, he does not push you into something you are not sure about. I appreciate his approach of showing you options but leaving you space and time to make your own decision. <br/><br/>- RICHARD Z,   May 08, 2017<br/>Ian helped us find the absolute perfect apartment. He was so attentive and persistent and would not rest until we had he place that we wanted. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone looking for a new home!

Select units provide spacious balconies and terrace with amazing city views! Pet Friendly! Other Amenities include:  -Furnished Rooftop Deck  -Gym  -Package room.  ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD:  Midwood certainly isn't topping anyone's list of most popular New York City neighborhoods, but perhaps its under-the-radar and somewhat insular vibe is part of the appeal. It is more steeped in tradition and perhaps that's because this south-central Brooklyn neighborhood hasn't given in to the rest of Brooklyn's hip factor. Midwood doesn't have many bars but it's got plenty of hookah lounges. It doesn't have many gyms but the streets are quiet and shaded, perfect for long walks. Its cafes don't boast single-origin beans or co-working spaces so much as a comfortable place to meet friends over pastries. One block of mansions gives way to a set of apartment buildings the same way a small shish-kebab cafe sits beside a seller of mink hats and silk stockings. Welcome to Midwood!  -Ideally located on Avenue P, just off Ocean Avenue.  -You will have easy access to the B (express) & Q trains at Kings Highway station.  -Just a 35 Minute ride to Time Square.
